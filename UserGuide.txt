User Guide

The program is broken up into two main parts: the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi.
The Arduino is programmed to open a serial connection and establishes a baud rate
for transferring data from the capacitive soil moisture sensors. The Arduino is 
powered and transmits data through the USB port of the Raspberry Pi. Upload the 
soilsensorsetup.ino file to the Arduino, then plug the Arduino into the Raspberry
Pi. 

On the Raspberry Pi, the data is received and the program creates sensor objects
and populates them with the data from each sensor. Initially, the program is only 
set up for two moisture sensors. Depending on the values read in from the sensor,
a state machine determines if the moisture levels of the soil is acceptable. These 
values were determined experimentally by noting the value read by the sensors when
held in water and when dried off completely. Depending on the level of moisture,
LEDs will power on indicating the state of the soil. A red LED means the soil is
dry and the plant needs water. Yellow means there is some moisture in the soil. A 
green LED means the soil is moist and the plant does not need to be watered.
